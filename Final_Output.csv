Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?
At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.
To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.

While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.

The Coinbase Developer Platform APIs are the easiest way for developers to get started with building crypto applications. Conceived by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, these APIs enable those with no prior knowledge of crypto to begin sending and receiving crypto in as little as 30 seconds. A top priority of the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), the CDP APIs encapsulate some of the most cutting-edge technologies in crypto by externalizing Coinbase’s internal services, built over more than a decade of experience. The CDP APIs combine custodial and non-custodial wallets into one clean abstraction, making interactions with the blockchain simple and painless.

The CDP API team owns both server-side APIs and client-side libraries across different languages. The team seeks a full-stack engineer who is passionate about all aspects of excellent developer experiences: authoring clear and informative documentation, building compelling sample applications, interacting directly with customers to incorporate feedback, architecting delightfully simple SDKs, etc. The engineer must be comfortable operating in both frontend and backend codebases, fluent across a variety of programming languages, and demonstrate both high code velocity and quality simultaneously. The CDP API team consists of some of the most prolific and tenured software engineers at Coinbase, and is excited to ship a game-changing set of APIs and SDKs at breakneck speed.
 
What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):
⦁    Design, develop, and maintain scalable, secure, and high-performance backend systems for the CDP APIs using Go and Javascript
⦁    Define and maintain clean and conformant HTTP REST API definitions using OpenAPI specifications
⦁    Design, develop, and maintain ergonomic, open-source SDKs to interact with the CDP APIs using Ruby, Typescript, Go, Python, and Java 
⦁    Author, publish, and maintain clear and concise documentation, including quickstart and how-to guides, to increase adoption of the Platform APIs and SDKs
⦁    Develop secure and scalable key management systems, packaged as Docker images, to enable crypto wallet functionality across a range of custodial configurations (e.g. self-custodial MPC)
⦁    Work closely with many different teams at Coinbase to externalize their backend services through the Platform APIs, ensuring consistency of concepts, style, and design
⦁    Interface directly with customers to collect their feedback and iteratively improve the CDP APIs and SDKs
⦁    Build compelling sample applications end-to-end using the CDP APIs and SDKs to demonstrate their value and pressure-test the developer experience
⦁    Troubleshoot and debug complex fullstack issues, ensuring stability, reliability, and security
⦁    Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback to maintain high code quality standards
 What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):
⦁    5+ years of experience in both backend and frontend software development
⦁    Mastery of JavaScript and Python; experience with TypeScript, Ruby, Go, and Java is a plus
⦁    Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with an eye for detail and a passion for clear, comprehensive developer documentation
⦁    Strong understanding of crypto wallets, including key management, cryptography, and blockchain protocols (e.g. EVM)
⦁    Proven track record of designing, developing, and shipping high-quality, ergonomic client-side libraries and SDKs
⦁    Strong understanding of distributed systems, microservices architecture, and event-driven architectures
⦁    Experience with databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) and caching systems (Redis, Memcached)
⦁    Solid knowledge of RESTful API design principles and experience with API development and integration
⦁    Familiarity with AWS and containerization technologies like Kubernetes
⦁    Understanding of security best practices and experience with implementing secure coding practices for financial systems
⦁    Crypto-forward experience, including familiarity with onchain activity such as interacting with Ethereum addresses, using ENS, and engaging with dApps or blockchain-based services.

At Nutrient, we equip developers and innovators with cutting-edge tools to simplify workflows and accelerate impactful software creation.

Our software development kits enable companies to work smarter and faster, saving time and expenses along the way, while effectively replacing the need for paper processes.
Your Role at Nutrient…
The team you will be joining is responsible for the Nutrient Web SDK. Take a look at its API docs to get an understanding of the scope involved: It is a toolbox for web engineers and application developers who need a painless way to render, edit and process documents. It either runs client-side using WebAssembly or connects to the Nutrient Document Engine.
This means that our SDK has to work for diverse use cases we constantly keep learning about from our customers. It needs to be convenient to use and easy to integrate; well architected, tested and documented; and loved by LLMs.
Your day to day work ranges (depending on your personal preferences and the current priorities) from writing code and documentation to talking directly with customers in order to understand their use cases and devise solutions for them, which you will incorporate into the evolving architecture of the product.
If you think you have the aptitude to contribute to building this product we would like to hear from you. You'll have autonomy, learn a lot and will shape the future of this product.
What You’ll Bring…
Strong General Programming Skills: You're well versed in OOP & FP, data structures & algorithms and understand that even a client-side SDK forms part of a larger distributed system. You’re driven by a curiosity to understand how things work.
Passion for Building in the B2D Space:  You don't write code for the sake of it, but to provide value to our customers by getting the user/developer experience right

 About Us
DynamiCare Health is a digital therapeutics startup that helps people overcome addiction. In 8 peer-reviewed publications, DynamiCare increased quit rates for opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco by 2-4x compared to typical treatment. DynamiCare has won FDA Breakthrough Status and is already breaking into U.S. healthcare system reimbursement with partners that include the State of Rhode Island, Allegheny County of Pennsylvania, BCBS of Massachusetts, Horizon BCBSNJ, Spring Health, and Cityblock Health. 
We understand that recovery isn't one-size-fits-all, which is why our platform provides the flexibility and continuous support needed for sustainable behavior change. We're transforming addiction care and helping more people reclaim their lives from substance use disorders. Through the Digital Recovery Platform, DynamiCare is bringing proven therapeutic approaches into the digital age, making recovery support available whenever and wherever our members need it most.
 About the job
Working as a Full-Stack Engineer at DynamiCare, you'll join a fully remote Agile team to design, build, and maintain secure, evidence-based applications. Since we're a small business, you'll have the opportunity to wear many different hats related to DevOps, Security, and other engineering-related fields. 
As the primary developer at DynamiCare, you'll have ownership over the codebase, making this a huge opportunity for impact. There will also be room for growth in terms of leadership as the team expands, with potential to shape practices, mentor future developers, and take on greater responsibility in technical decision-making.
We are currently striving to expand our user base and increase retention rates, with a Series A funding round on the horizon. We use a Ruby on Rails application, which powers multiple subdomains and includes a REST API that supports our member-facing React Native mobile app, as well as an Analytics application utilizing ActionView, React, and Stimulus.
We believe DynamiCare is a great place to work. You'll collaborate in real time to make informed product decisions and play an active role in shaping the company's direction every day. We value your time and mental well-being, and we offer flexibility in working hours and time off. While there may be times when you need to jump in to resolve a critical bug, we strive to stay calm, focus on the root cause, and improve our workflows rather than place blame.
Here are some examples of the work you might be doing at DynamiCare:
Monitoring and responding to mobile and server package vulnerabilities, applying patches promptly, and evaluating whether they pose any risk to our users.
Refactor Rails models to enhance feature development and data processing efficiency.
Improve our appointment tracking features to include recurring appointments.
Maintaining a probability engine used to schedule substance tests, ensuring functionality by writing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.
Building new serializers in Rails to help export data in XLSX or CSV format so that our team has insights on key metrics.
Creating and maintaining new background jobs to improve the scalability and performance of our application.
Ensuring data security, privacy, and compliance with HIPAA.
 About you
We’re seeking a candidate with a passion for technology and a motivation to make the world a better place.
Your primary responsibilities will include full-stack development, DevOps, and maintaining strong data security across our platform. You should have at least three years of experience with our core frameworks: Ruby on Rails and React Native. Experience deploying and managing applications using CircleCI, Aptible, and AWS is especially valuable.
Experience working within the confines of HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 is a strong plus, given the sensitive nature of our work. We’re also looking for someone familiar with Agile development, particularly Scrum and sprint-based workflows. Proficiency with collaboration and project management tools like Asana, Confluence, and Jira is important for staying aligned with the team.
Even though you’re experienced, we don’t expect you to hit the ground running on day one. We value thoughtful onboarding and provide you with the time and support needed to learn our systems and processes. Strong communication is essential here, whether you're debugging code, collaborating with designers, or explaining technical concepts to non-technical teammates. 
We also foster a collaborative environment where every voice is heard, and respectful dialogue and constructive feedback are encouraged. Our shared goal is to build a product that helps people recover from addiction, and we believe that happens best when everyone works together with openness and clarity.
A Computer Science degree or equivalent is not required for this position. If you have the chops and the skills needed to do the job well, that’s all that matters.
While you’ll report to our Director of IT & Engineering, we strongly believe in autonomy here at DynamiCare. It’s vital that you know how to manage your time, and we trust that you will as well. Investing the time and effort here will help advance your career and expose you to new and exciting challenges.
This position is remote and operates on Eastern Time. You’re free to work wherever you succeed the most: whether it be at home or in a coffee shop. We are hiring from anywhere in the United States.

The way we work:
This is a remote job - work anywhere you want, and in any timezone on earth (or outside earth, whatever).
We are an asynchronous team - we don't do scheduled meetings, and rely on each team member to pick their own schedule and to communicate clearly in writing and with recorded videos. Hear from our co-founder Michelle Lee on what it's like to work asynchronously (click here).
We operate completely autonomously - no one will tell you what to do, we'll just tell you the goals and you will figure out how to work towards them with the rest of the team.
The role you'll play on our team:
You'd be one of the first ten engineers on the team.
You'll work on
Backend: database design and implementation, complex data management problems, API design and implementation, writing tests
Frontend: building features in our react app, HTML/CSS + styled components, building amazing user experiences, writing tests
Frontend and backend: building and iterating on our product, collaborating with designers and founders, and making a product that users will love.
Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at market-rate, including benefits.

Our interview process

Our interview process is designed to focus on your skills as a software engineer, and your ability to communicate clearly. We're a fully asynchronous company, so that's how we will communicate in this interview process too 🙂.

We'll ask you to work on a small code challenge
After reviewing the short code challenge, we'll ask you to work on a ~90 minute exercise while recording a loom (or other screen recording) video.
If the video interview above goes well, we'll want to learn a bit more about how you communicate in writing - we will ask you to put together a technical design document. This is one of the biggest ways we communicate at Subscript, so we want to see that you can work well with that!
And finally, hopefully we'll send you an offer. And hopefully you'll accept!

Requirements

You're an excellent engineer (you write high quality code, you write great tests, you ship quickly)
You're a great communicator via writing, and via recorded videos.
You're excited about working on a globally-distributed and diverse team, in an incredibly unique culture where autonomy, accountability, and ownership are equally as valued as your skillset.
That's it!

We’re Ace Stainless Supply — a California-based leader in stainless steel fittings and industrial flow control components. Our new vertical, www.AceCompressionFittings.com, is a Shopify-based e-commerce site built to serve industrial customers looking for compression fittings fast. We ship and handle all fulfillment in-house — your job is to make the website move product and compete with www.acestainless.com
This is a ground-floor opportunity for someone who knows Shopify and digital commerce inside and out and is ready to take full ownership of a fast-growing e-commerce platform.
What We’re Looking For:
We're seeking a full-time remote E-Commerce Manager who will operate with autonomy, confidence, and proven results. You’ll be responsible for managing every aspect of the Shopify site — from design and SEO to campaign launches and order flow through our ERP (INxSQL).
This is not a “junior” marketing role. This is a full-stack Shopify operator who can confidently say:
 “I’ve grown a store before — and here’s the data to prove it.”
“I understand ERP integrations, pricing logic, customer journeys, and email funnels.”
“I know how to create urgency, run specials, and build long-term engagement.”
Your Core Responsibilities:
Full ownership of AceCompressionFittings.com (Shopify Plus)
Website design, layout, and UI/UX optimization
SEO strategy and execution to boost organic visibility
Manage and launch Mailchimp campaigns (monthly + promotional)
Track customer behavior, retargeting, and email segmentation
Launch new product categories and manage product detail pages
Run pricing updates, discount campaigns, and promotions
Be 100% in charge of the online order cycle — including manually placing orders in our ERP until API sync is complete
Track key performance metrics weekly and provide reports
Participate in daily 9:00 AM PST team meetings via Microsoft Teams
Be available for customer support and engagement M-F 8am - 4:30PM PST
Required Experience:
3+ years managing Shopify-based stores (preferably Shopify Plus)
Familiarity with ERPs (especially INxSQL or similar systems)
Track record of scaling e-commerce sales and customer engagement
Advanced understanding of SEO, Mailchimp, and conversion tools
Strong attention to detail — especially with pricing, orders, and product data
Excellent communication skills — clear, responsive, and proactive
Comfortable with remote work accountability, reports, and structure
Compensation & Incentives:
Base Salary: $1,500/month
Negotiable: Higher base available for proven performers (please justify in your application)
Performance-Based Incentive Plan:
2% revenue bonus monthly on all website revenue above $25,000
4% bonus on any monthly revenue over $50,000
Special quarterly bonuses for major growth milestones
The above is negotiable and can be discussed.  We want results and will pay you 
How to Apply:
We don’t want a resume — we want results.
Please submit a brief business plan or pitch deck outlining:
Your past Shopify e-commerce success (with revenue and growth numbers)
What would you do in your first 90 days with us? 
Why you believe you can grow www.acecompressionfittings.com
Tools, strategies, or integrations you'd propose?
5-7 minute Video telling us about you and why you would accelerate at this role
Optional: include 2-3 screenshots or short videos showing your past work
